# BT2201 Second Assignment 2019/20

## Introduction

### Overview

This is the repository for all files that form part of your second assignment.  **You can find the assignment handout in the Assignment area of the BT2201 Blackboard space.** 


### Editing

#### The quick way...

If you like you can create documents and edit them directly in GitHub's web interface. This is a very convenient way of creating and editing the files. 


#### The preferred way...

The preferred way of working is to create and edit the files on your own machine. 

To get the repository to your own machine you can use GitHub Desktop or link your GitHub account to PHPStorm. There are many more ways but these two are very convenient. 
* You then upload these files to bimserver2 for testing.
* You commit changes and push the commits to your GitHub account to create a history of the changes over time.
* You _can_ work on several machines and use commits as a way of keeping the files on different machines up to date. 

You can find an explanation how to use PHPStorm to manage projects hosted on GitHub at https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/github.html . 

### Uploading 

If you want to test your files you should upload them to your web space on bimserver2.com. 

You can use FileZilla to upload the files, but it can also be done in PHPStorm. You can find an explanation how to use PHPStorm to upload files and folder at https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/uploading-and-downloading-files.html .


## Important

Please make sure to..

* Add the final URL on bimserver2.com to a comment at the top of your files, like we did for previous tasks. 
* Give the page(s) a meaningful title (`<title></title>`).
* Upload the file(s) to your area on bimserver2.com.

You are welcome to copy and paste HTML, PHP and MySQL from my lecture slides, but the quotes might need changing from opening double quotes (“) and closing double quotes (”) to straight double quotes ("). 
 
**Commit early, commit often** - that way you can go back if you have made a mistake and I can see all the work you have done. There's no problem if you commit early and there's a mistake in your early version of that file.  

Once you are done be sure to commit your changes (that will save them to the repository) and to push them to GitHub (so that I can see the work you have done).
